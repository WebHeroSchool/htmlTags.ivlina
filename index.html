        <h1>Finding Meaning in Motherhood During Lockdown</h1>

                As we bear witness to the profoundly humbling phenomena of the world coming to a screeching halt at the behest of a
                microscopic entity – and the closing of the arrogant ‘end of history’ exceptionalist mythology – we are all now in
                unchartered territory whereby the very ground in which we’ve rooted ourselves has been unceremoniously ripped from
                beneath us. As the multiple and varied factors which make up our worldly existence dissipate into thin air, as well as
                the stresses that we face concerning our material needs, we also face an existential challenge to repurpose ourselves in
                this incubation period – to reframe our ideals and values according to a new reality, in isolation, without the external
                validation of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a person of faith, I find myself searching for meaning in these circumstances that have taken on a life of their own,
                beyond the sphere of human influence. A global pandemic in which individual actions can lead to dire consequences on a
                local, national and international scale, should give us the opportunity to reflect on how we all, in our own capacity,
                impact the fabric of society. Particularly in the digital age of hyperconnectivity where we are more interlinked than
                ever. Where we see the ruptures COVID-19 has created in our social structures, we also see chinks in our social armour,
                areas for us all to make an improvement in the long term, and the need to modify our living. That one extra trip to the
                supermarket because we feel entitled to a particular standard of living could quite literally cost a life. And while the
                health implications for the majority of us will be negligible, the accumulative effect of this virus – that we are all
                potential carriers of – is lethal on a social level and catastrophic on a national and international level.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Muslims, this should remind us to be conscious of how our smaller actions, that are visible only to Allah, not only
                have wide-scale impact, but equally form our moral character – and are a source of great barakah – and therefore should
                be given as much consideration as major life choices concerning the hijab, the beard, our mortgages…
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking beyond oneself and seeing ourselves with the potential to create better conditions for all – either through
                consumer or more significant life choices – is something we would all do well in carrying into life post-Corona.

                Life in quarantine should also give us the opportunity, and impetus, to reflect on how we see ourselves outside of this
                social structure, stripped bare of all of the external accessories that have so far formed our identity. The crutches we
                all unavoidably employ in order to present ourselves to the world no longer have any ground for leverage, and we are
                having to grapple with questions regarding our very sense of purpose and identity.
